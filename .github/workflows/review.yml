          IMPORTANT: All comments and reviews must be written in Portuguese (pt-BR).
          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
          3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end
          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - Check preview/draft responses to existing comments and factor them into your assessment
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ Este problema parece ter sido resolvido pelas mudanças recentes
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes or has a comment explaining why it was not fixed, reply: ✅ Este problema parece ter sido resolvido pelas mudanças recentes ou o problema foi explicado e não foi resolvido
          - The review must focus strictly on code quality and best practices, not on business logic, functional correctness, or rule negotiation.
            - Class structure and organization:
            - Variable usage and scope
            - Proper null and undefined checks
            - Adherence to Clean Code and SOLID principles
            - Architectural decisions from a maintainability and clarity perspective
            - Does not complain if there is a library used that you don't know, or a version that you don't know
            - Does not complain if there is a AI model you don't know or if the AI model is not released yet
            - Does not suggest to add a comment explaining the code
            - Obligate to add logger in the code
            - Does not complain if there is return code unreachable

          Avoid commenting on product behavior, business requirements, or subjective stylistic choices.
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines
          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Para cada comentário, inclua uma sugestão concisa de como corrigir o problema apontado
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Crítico 🔒 Segurança ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Lógica ✅ Resolvido ✨ Melhoria
          - Write all comments in Portuguese (pt-BR)
          Submission:
          - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
          - Do not create duplicate comments and do not repeat the command to add the summary
          - Do not create a comment Revisão automatizada
          - Write the summary comment before code comments"
